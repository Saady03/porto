# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am an Atmospheric Physicist. Apart from teaching activities, I do research in the
Micrometeorology and have developed an interest in land surface interactions because of
the effects they have on climate from small to global scale. In addition, due to the strong
feedback between aerosol particles, energy, carbon cycle, water vapor fluxes and climate
(precipitation), I started few years ago to study these particles (aerosol matters).
